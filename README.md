# Winkler Linked List 001
***************************************************************************************
This is my first attempt to load a program that I know works onto Github.

If you're reading this, you are Dr. Woodcock, and I uploaded the assignment correctly!
If you are not Dr. Woodcock, then enjoy my homework. Please don't change anything 
without telling me somehow! I don't know how this works yet.

What it is supposed to do:
This program is designed to take integers and put them in a stack, via a linked list. 
Users may add and delete integers, display an ordered list of the previously entered 
numbers, and clear the display area.

Adding
The integers are collected by you entering a number between -999999999 and 999999999 in
the first text box. Once you are satisfied with your number, hit the "Add" button. Your
number gets added to the list in the order you add numbers. 

Deleting
To delete a number from the list, enter a number you have stored and click the "Delete"
button. If you try to delete a number you did not already put on the list, you will get
an error message explaining so. If you delete nothing, the same thing will happen.

Display
This button does just what it says; it displays the stack. I've also added a method that
organizes the list in ascending numerical value, so you may easily identify numbers for
deletion. 

Clear
This button clears the display area of whatever happens to be currently displayed.

I tried to eliminate crashes on bad input with a few try/catches. I know there ways to 
break it anyway, I just don't know enough about programming or Java to find them all.

Anyway, thanks for reading this!
